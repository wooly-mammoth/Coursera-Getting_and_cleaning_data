# Variables used:
The variables in the dataset are the following:

### Subject:
Subject: the integer ID which identifies the users that participated in the experiment.

### Activity: the string activity name:
* Walking
* Walking Upstairs
* Walking Downstairs
* Sitting
* Standing
* Laying

# Output:
All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are floating point numbers.
